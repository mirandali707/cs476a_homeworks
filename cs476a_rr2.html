<p>I&#39;m responding to Principle 2.4 in Artful Design: take advantage of physicality. The book describes how in the design of Ocarina, care was taken to ensure that the app &quot;responds&quot; to user input in a way which recalls the physical world, such as for example the buttons &quot;flattening&quot; when pressed and the user&#39;s breath propagating a green &quot;wave&quot;. I think this idea is fascinating because I feel in a way that I&#39;ve understood this intuitively for a while -- I like to draw and I like statistics and computer science, and because of these things many friends and colleagues have encouraged me to explore the realm of algorithmic art. I&#39;ve given it my best shot multiple times, but there&#39;s something irreplaceable about a physical drawing you can touch and smudge. No matter how hard I&#39;ve tried I just can&#39;t get into purely digital art -- the constraints and reactions of the physical world are too familiar to me to eschew. As such, I very deeply understand the need for some sort of reference to the physical world when designing virtual interfaces.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve actually noticed this sort of principle in all sorts of places -- for example the way that when you close a window on a Mac it whisks itself back into its icon like a genie in a bottle so you know what to click (the icon) if you want to get the window back later. In my brief forays into web development, I&#39;ve also noticed that Google&#39;s Material Design principles also frequently recall the physical world (buttons are &quot;pressed&quot; when clicked by altering the drop shadow to convey depth, etc.).</p>
<p>I think it&#39;s interesting to think of this balance, in artfully designing software tools, between referencing the physical world whilst also maintaining the magic of a virtual world where the constraints of the physical world don&#39;t apply. After all, one of the reasons we&#39;re interested in software tools to begin with is that in the virtual space we are able to subvert and escape the confines of physical reality. I think it&#39;s hard to have a concrete rule for what sort of balance to strike here, other than to try things out and see what feels good and what doesn&#39;t. I think it&#39;s fun that in the virtual world we get to pick and choose when physics applies and when it doesn&#39;t, and that we can use this balance to convey different feelings about the world we are building.</p>
