<p>I found the roll a ball tutorial to be really really informative and helpful. I think it might take me a second to get used to the ways in which certain Unity GUI interface interactions are required to link the variables to the code, but with my basic knowledge of animation and callbacks from past programming things I felt really really comfortable with all the code we wrote. I&#39;m still a bit clunky navigating the scene in Unity but I know that will improve as I work.</p>
<p>The Chunity tutorial was also straightforward and helpful, and I liked that adding sound to roll-a-ball enhanced the gameplay a lot, in my opinion. I love the chaotic, spatialized, burbling pickup object. It doesn&#39;t seem too much harder than scripting in Unity to add Chuck into Unity (though I may regret saying this later).</p>
<p>sndpeek is funky. I had fun making stupid noises at my computer.</p>
