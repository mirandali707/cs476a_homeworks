<h2 id="bevins-a-narrative"><a class="header-link" href="#bevins-a-narrative"></a>Bevins, a narrative</h2>
<p>One idea for my final project is to expand upon my music sequencer. My idea here is to have a storyline, with multiple scenes, which describes the life and death of Roger Bevins, all in the same creepy, collage-y style of my music sequencer, but with more complexity -- I&#39;m hoping to get into rigging different collaged parts together to produce &quot;puppets&quot; of Bevins, I want scene transitions, I want non-playable characters, etc.</p>

<p>Another idea I&#39;m interested in is combining hand-drawn animation with Chunity. I&#39;m thinking something along the lines of an infinite loop of a bunch of quirky characters dancing to a predetermined track, and when a key is pressed, at the next beat the track is changed or altered and a different set of frames is played, but the frames have been drawn so that the motion appears to be seamless, as though the whole thing is one long animated video. I hope this makes sense.</p>
<h2 id="tour-of-my-plants"><a class="header-link" href="#tour-of-my-plants"></a>Tour of my plants</h2>
<p>Lastly, I have an idea which involves photographing and reassembling my plants as 3D objects in unity with image textures. Each part will correspond to a noise, and the whole thing will be rigged so that touching one part of the plant influences all the others. This is inspired by me spending a lot of time staring at / playing with my plants -- I have noticed that plants are such delicate physical systems that usually perturbing one leaf will also perturn something else -- the leaf stalk, the stem, a neighboring leaf, etc. I like the idea of the audio for the corresponding pieces being distorted fittingly.</p>
